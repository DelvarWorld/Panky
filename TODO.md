# TODO

* Github Hook Secret Signing Support (`hub.secret` on
    [Repo * Hooks](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/))
* DBIx::Class w/SQLite db
* Settings/config for what github events to 'say' in chatroom?
* Jenkins API Integration
* Make the '/' page look better (good)
* Make Chat modules more generic to support more chat-types (irc, etc).
* More fun Chat Modules/Plugins
    - Generic GitHubShortener - shorten all github.com/ urls it sees
* HookActor that aggregates all types of certain actions daily/weekly/monthly?
    - 'gh activity today' would maybe show PRs closed for the day, etc.
* Git Deploy/Merge Support
    - 'panky deploy blah blah blah' to deploy stuff
