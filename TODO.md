# TODO

* Papertrailapp chat/hook modules
* Github Hook Secret Signing Support (`hub.secret` on
    [Repo * Hooks](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/))
* Make the '/' page look better (good)
* HookActor that aggregates all types of certain actions daily/weekly/monthly?
    - 'gh activity today' would maybe show PRs closed for the day, etc.
* Git Deploy/Merge Support
    - 'panky deploy blah blah blah' to deploy stuff
    - 'panky merge site dev => master' merge sit repo dev branch into master
* Make it easier to deploy custom modules with heroku/dotcloud
    - specific buildpacks?
    - https://gist.github.com/3750894 (doesn't quite work yet)
